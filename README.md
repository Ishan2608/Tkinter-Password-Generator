# Password Generator

Welcome to the Password Generator project! This GitHub repository hosts a user-friendly GUI application designed to help you manage your passwords securely. Whether you need a strong, randomly generated password or want to search for a saved password for a specific website, this Password Generator has you covered.

## Overview

The Password Generator is a versatile GUI app built using Python and Tkinter. It allows you to maintain and generate passwords for various websites, saving them in a convenient JSON file. With error handling for duplicate entries and non-existent websites, you can trust that your password data is managed with utmost care.

## Technologies Used

The Password Generator project harnesses the following technologies:

- **Python:** The core language that powers the app's logic and controls the flow of data.

- **Tkinter:** Used to create the graphical user interface, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.


## Error Handling

The Password Generator incorporates robust error handling:

1. **Duplicate Entry Error:** If you attempt to save a password for a website that already exists in the saved data, an error will be shown to prevent overwriting the existing data unintentionally.

2. **Non-Existent Website Error:** When you search for a password for a website that does not exist in the saved data, an error message will be displayed, guiding you to add the new website with its password.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from intermediate-level developers interested in improving and expanding the Password Generator. Whether you have ideas for new features, UI enhancements, or error-handling improvements, your contributions are highly valued. Please feel free to raise issues and submit pull requests to contribute to the project's growth.
